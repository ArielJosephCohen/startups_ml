# **Introduction**

### The goal of my project is to determine where a startup will end up in a couple years. Specifically, whether it will fail, be operative, or acquired given certain parameters surrounding the startup and its funding.

### My data is sourced from kaggle.com and consists of 54294 rows with 38 predictive features aimed at target which is a multi-class prediction (0 - failed, 1 - operational, 2 - acquired). Most of the features discuss funding and since there are so few with actual funding (in the different features) I basically split them into groups with funding and groups without rather than look at the actual numbers. That's a little part of my data cleaning, which I find interesting.
